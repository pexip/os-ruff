# About salsa

Salsa is a Rust framework for writing incremental, on-demand programs
-- these are programs that want to adapt to changes in their inputs,
continuously producing a new output that is up-to-date. Salsa is based
on the the incremental recompilation techniques that we built for
rustc, and many (but not all) of its users are building compilers or
other similar tooling.

If you'd like to learn more about Salsa, check out:

- The [overview](./overview.md), for a brief summary.
- The [tutorial](./tutorial.md), for a detailed look.
- You can also watch some of our [videos](./videos.md), though the content there is rather out of date.
