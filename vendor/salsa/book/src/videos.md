There is currently one video available on the newest version of Salsa:

- [Salsa Architecture Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrnNvAAoQFk),
  which covers many aspects of the redesigned architecture.

There are also two videos on the older version Salsa, but they are rather
outdated:

- [How Salsa Works](https://youtu.be/_muY4HjSqVw), which gives a high-level
  introduction to the key concepts involved and shows how to use Salsa;
- [Salsa In More Depth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_IhACacPRY), which digs
  into the incremental algorithm and explains -- at a high-level -- how Salsa is
  implemented.
